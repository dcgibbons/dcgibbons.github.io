This week I went swimming laps two times. The first time was a rude awakening.
Not only did the swim kick my ass, it was distressing just how poor I was
swimming in otherwise good condition. I realized later I started way too fast,
and went too early in the morning, before I had eaten anything.

Later in the week I went again, and went deliberately slow and focused
primarily on the breaststroke instead of the freestyle. The second experience
was much better than the first. I was able to get quite a few laps in and felt
great afterwards.

I realized after the first time I went that I hadn't been lap swimming since
high school, when I was on the swim team... so since about 1986. Even though
I'm in much better shape now than I ever was then, I don't know how to swim
anywhere near as good as I did then!

Here's looking forward to many more swims!
