Saturday night we saw the latest [Indiana Jones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/) movie. As with most movies I avoided learning anything about it before I saw it just to make sure I didn't have any preconceived notions.

I had heard how much [Harrison Ford](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/) had focused on getting into top shape again for this role, although he wasn't as in good as shape as I would have guessed. But then again, I can only hope I am in that good of shape at 65 years of age.

I heard some rumbling from folks that the whole sci-fi twist at the end wasn't becoming of an Indy movie, but I found that it fit the series perfectly. There has always been a lot of conjecture that the Nazca lines were made for "aliens" so playing into that storyline doesn't seem far fetched or out-of-line to me at all.

While [Cate Blanchett](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/) is always nice to look at, I didn't quite buy her role as a Soviet scientist. But hey, suspension of disbelief and all that.

Overall I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars.
