It is just about 3am and we are seeing hurricane force conditions here in Sugar Land. The sustained winds are strong enough that the whole house is groaning and any tiny gap in weatherstripping is acting like a flute. We've had at least tropical storm force conditions for the past 6 hours. Rain really did not arrive until 3 hours ago.

We've been without power for 3 hours now, but luckily the cellular data network is still alive.

The news reports that landfall for the center of the storm was just before 3. We've got another 8 hours or so of bad weather to sit out.
