At the Erlang User Conference 2017 (EUC17) in Stockholm Sweden, I presented
our experience of how [Alert Logic](http://www.alertlogic.com/) moved to a new
micro-services architecture using our preferred programming language:
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org).

[Alert Logic](http://www.alertlogic.com/) had been using Erlang for years
before, but we really did not have a holistic platform for building
applications. A small team of us went off and build a new product for the
company, and in doing so build a new application platform using micro-services
patterns and written in the Erlang programming language.

You can watch a recording of the presentation below, as well as review the
[slide deck](https://speakerdeck.com/dcgibbons/erlang-micro-services-with-all-the-buzzwords).
