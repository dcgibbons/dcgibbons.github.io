Tonight I finished reading _Blackwood Farm_ by Anne Rice. It is another book in The Vampire Chronicles and marks my return to her work after a very long hiatius. After her horrible book _Violin_, I effectively swore off her works for over a decade. I was reluctant to return but at the same time I always enjoyed The Vampire Chronicles enough that I finally gave in.

And, I'm glad I did. The story contained within was a good one. It wasn't her best writing by any means, but the storytelling itself was wonderful.

This book is all about a young vampire that tells the story of himself, his family, and his twin brother's ghost to the infamous vampire Lestat.

I'd give it 3 stars out of 5.
