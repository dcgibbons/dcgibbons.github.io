Today was [The Space Race](http://www.spacerace.org/), a ride starting from
[Gulf Greyhound Park](http://www.gulfgreyhound.com/) in La Marque, Texas. La
Marque is between Houston and Galveston, but closer overall to Galveston. The
ride is usually the last large organized ride before the annual [BP
MS150](http://www.ms150.org/ms150/) in mid-April and is always one of my
favorites.

It was a great, fast ride. I left with the 20+ MPH crowd at the start and was
able to ride in pace-lines the entire day. Towards the second half of the ride
I hooked up with a group that had us riding between 18 and 22 MPH for the rest
of the ride. The end result was 104 miles in 06:21:05 elapsed with an average
of 19.2 MPH.

The other great thing of the day was discovering [Pickle Juice
Sport](http://www.goldenpicklejuice.com/) for the first time. What an awesome
drink!
