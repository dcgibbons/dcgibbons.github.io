As of 7:30 pm our local power came on. We're hoping that it stays on through
the night at a minimum, and really hopeful it is back on permanently. I spoke
with my parents in the Houston Heights area of town and they said power is not
back on in their section of the neighborhood, but it is a few blocks over, so
hopefully power will be restored in most parts of the "city" areas that are
away from the coast in short-order. Right now, CenterPoint Energy is saying
power will take 2 to 3 weeks to be fully restored, but given the damage to the
coastal areas this is not too much of a surprise.

Lori and I walked around our neighborhood and took some pictures of the
damage. It is clear that we personally got very lucky - we have no damage at
all, save a couple of tree branches that we've already cleaned up. Many other
people in our neighborhood and surrounding ones have substantial damage from
fallen trees on their homes, and many of the older fences and trees have been
destroyed. There is debris everywhere. The good news is that, for the most
part, the wind was not high enough in this part of town to destroy structure
from wind alone. We saw no broken windows, a few torn gutters, and a handful
of shingles, but that's been it.

Some select pictures from our walk around the neighborhood:
