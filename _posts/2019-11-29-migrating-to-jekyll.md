title: 'Migrating to Jekyll'

After yet another security breach on my Wordpress blog, this time one that all
the great security tools didn't catch, I've decided to migrate to a static
page hosting solution.

I went with [Github Pages using
Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
which is a well-supported solution for this type of thing.

There are only two real downsides, for now:
  1. I lose the abilty for blog comments, but since that was the primary
     vector of security breaches, I'm not too sad about that.
  2. The theme / layouts are pretty ugly by default, so I have some work to do
     to get this looking good (not that it ever did).

I do like the idea of using markdown to create blog posts, and the standard
github workflow.
