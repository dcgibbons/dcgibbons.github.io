April 12th and 13th was the weekend for the [Sun and Ski](http://www.sunandski.com/) team this year after riding three years with the [BMC Software](http://www.bmc.com/) team. BMC cancelled their support of a cycling team which left all of us on it looking for a new home. Sun and Ski is one of the largest teams in the event which gives them great perks for the start of the event. We started from [Tully Stadium](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=tully+stadium,+houston,+texas&jsv=107&ie=UTF8&ll=29.78479,-95.594358&spn=0.037544,0.074501&t=h&z=14&iwloc=A) in Houston.

We showed up at the stadium at 0530 to beat the rush; unfortunately that meant 90 minutes of waiting in the cold morning. Luckily, Sun and Ski is the 2nd team out of the stadium, after the title sponsor [BP](http://www.bp.com/) led the way. The wind was around 8-10 MPH by the time we left the stadium and only proceeded to get stronger through the day. Most of day 1 is riding due West or Northwest, so the wind was to our side most of the day, but it still made for very difficult riding the entire day and greatly reduced our average speed.

We arrived at fairgrounds in La Grange at around 1730 after a very long 10 hours in the saddle. A quick massage followed by a bite to eat and a couple of beers helped to relax us after the long day. My friend Teri and her husband invited me to stay at their farm that night, which made for a very relaxing evening in a bed, rather than in a sleeping bag in the team tent at the fairgrounds.

We returned to the fairgrounds very early Sunday morning, getting in line by 0515. It was a very cold morning with temperatures at 42Â° F at dawn. Unfortunately my very thin jacket was not enough to keep me warm while we waited. We left our bikes in line and returned to the Sun and Ski tent to see if we could warm up, but unfortunately the coffee was already gone by that time. The announcer at the fairground kept telling everyone that the wind forecast of the day was for 0-5 MPH which made everyone excited about the coming ride.

We got underway at 0700 sharp and made it out of the fairgrounds in the third wave of rides. Unfortunately getting moving made it even colder for us and the lack of early morning Sun kept me shivering for the next 90 minutes. It wasn't until we reached [Buescher State Park](http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/buescher/) that I finally warmed up. The route between Buescher and [Bastrop State Park](http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/bastrop/) is my favorite part of the MS150 and I've chosen that route for every MS150 I've done, except for my very first. Park road 1C between the two parks can only be described as a roller coaster ride through pine trees. Those cyclists used to real mountains and hills would not be very impressed, but for those of us used to the coastal plain it is a wonderful challenge.

After the park we had lunch and then headed out for the last 35 miles or so of the ride. It was a tough afternoon with relatively intense sun and wind to go along with tired muscles. We made it to Austin just after 1600 after a long 9 hours in the saddle.&nbsp; We grabbed a quick bite to eat and a couple of beers and relaxed with our spouses at the Sun and Ski tent before leaving town. It was a great MS150, even though it was a very difficult one. I was very proud of my friend Teri: she made it through both days with a lot of poise and chose the more difficult route through the park rather than the easier route up TX-71.
