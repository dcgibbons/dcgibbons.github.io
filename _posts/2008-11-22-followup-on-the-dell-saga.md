When we last heard about the [Dell
Saga](http://chadgibbons.com/2008/09/12/positive-progress-on-the-dell-saga/) I
expected to have a credit from Dell a day or two after I made the post. As it
turned out, it didn't quite turn out that way.

Dell did indeed try to issue me a credit, but they screwed up and instead
charged my account for the amount of the laptop a second time. Not
surprisingly, when I called Dell customer service I got the same run-around
and an assurance that no, indeed, a credit was issued, and to "call back in 48
hours since it can take that long."

Since I finally wised up to the stalling tactic, I just called my credit card
issuer and had them issue another chargeback.

Two months later, the issue is finally resolved and the chargebacks have
cleared. What a freaking nightmare. Thanks, Dell!
