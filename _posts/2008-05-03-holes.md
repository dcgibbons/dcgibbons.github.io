On Saturday we watched the movie [Holes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311289/). A surprisingly good film from Disney, Holes is about a teenage boy who is wrongly accused of a crime and is sent to a juvenile work camp instead of prison. The camp is run by some shady characters and then the plot explores from there.

The best part of the film was the part played by Sigourney Weaver. She played a believable Texas country girl with a bad side. If I had run into this character one day in Dalhart I wouldn't haven't thought twice about it.

I'd give it a 3.5 stars out of 5.
