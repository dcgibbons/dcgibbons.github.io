We watched [The Guardian](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406816/) today, a movie about [US Coast Guard](http://www.uscg.mil/) rescue swimmers. Kevin Costner plays a Senior Master Chief that, even in middle age, remains one of the best rescue swimmers in the service. After an accident where all of his crew dies, his commanding officer forces him to take on an instructor job for rescue swimmers.

In the class, Ashton Kutcher plays the hotshot in class that wants to prove he's better than the Costner character. Yadda, yadda, yadda, standard storyline continues.

Overall it was an entertaining, if predictable movie. I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.
