Yesterday was another run, but unfortunately resulted in an injury. My left
knee was a bit sore from wearing some ill-fitting boots the day before, and I
wrongly assumed that the run would help it out rather than hurt it more.

I ran about three miles total, at a much faster pace than the prior runs, and
all it served to do was make the knee very difficult to walk on. The walk back
to the house was even worse.

A few hours of ice, compression, and Aleve helped a little bit, but a night's
rest with the compression seemed to help more. So far today I can walk on it
without any pain or discomfort, but it doesn't feel 100% either.

I think I'll take some time off from running and throw away those boots!
