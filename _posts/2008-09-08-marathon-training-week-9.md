Saturday finished up week # 9 of my marathon training program. Week # 9 followed a light week # 8 where we only ran 6 miles; we had 9 miles in the pipe for the Saturday long run. From what I understand, the light weeks are key in letting your body recover its strength for pushing further ahead so at first I was looking forward to the next long run.

Then on day 1 of week # 9 I got sick and was out of action until Tuesday. I wound up only running two runs during the week, instead of the 4 runs I had planned. When Saturday rolled around I still didn't feel 100% but decided I need to try the full run anyway. I wound up running with my friend Teri at [Sugar Land Memorial Park](http://www.sugarlandtx.gov/parks_recreation/parks_facilities/community_parks/brazos_river_corridor.asp) instead of my big running group. Because of the layout of the park's trails we wound up running closer to 10 miles instead of 9, total.

Bottom line: 10 miles was a real bitch. I felt pretty worn out after being sick during the week and without my normal pacing group I found it much harder to maintain a consistent pace or plan my own. Towards the end I was going, very, very slow. Overall, I finished right at 2 hours, for a 12:00 minute/mile average pace, compared to the 10:00 minute/mile average pace I had been averaging on the longer runs. I also found that all the little things the old timers warned me about was completely true: at runs past 90 minutes in time you start to find new places that hurt.

This week, # 10, is only scheduled for 10 miles so I'll get a chance to do 10 miles again before pushing forward.
