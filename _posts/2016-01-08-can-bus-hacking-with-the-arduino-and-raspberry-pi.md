In December of 2013, I published a set of videos on YouTube discussing how to
do CAN bus hacking using an Arduino and/or Raspberry Pi. These videos were
made in conjunction with my Jeep hacking projects.

Several viewers have asked for a little bit more information on getting an
Arduino and Raspberry Pi to talk to one another over a CAN bus, so I thought
I'd provide a bit of written information here to accompany the videos. In
addition, two years of time have provided some improvements that make
everything easier.

For both the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi, I used
daughter boards that use Microchip's
[MCP2515](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/devices.aspx?dDocName=en010406)
CAN controller and
[MCP2551](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en010405)
CAN transceiver. These are extremely common integrated circuits for CAN and
are great to integrate with as they use an Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

#### The CAN Bus

A CAN bus has to be properly terminated on each end of the bus. The easiest
way to do this on a bench is using a breadboard. Use two 120 Î© resistors on
each end of one of the power rails to terminate the bus properly. You can then
connect your nodes to any location within the power rail and have them join
the bus properly.

Be sure to create a twisted pair out of each set of wires coming from each
node. CAN bus is highly resilient to electrical noise when each node follows
certain rules, and twisted pairs of wires is one of those rules.

#### The Arduino Setup

Sparkfun sells a [CAN bus shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13262)
designed by [SK Pang](http://skpang.co.uk/). This shield is great for
developing automotive-focused applications, and is extremely easy to use from
a software standpoint. Once built, the shield plugs into an Arduino with no
further configuration.

For software, the following should be downloaded:

1. My AVRDebug library - https://github.com/dcgibbons/AVRDebug
2. My "hello, world" application - https://github.com/dcgibbons/CANBusHello
3. The library for the Sparkfun / SK Pang shield - https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun\_CAN-Bus\_Arduino\_Library

Once built and downloaded, the project will broadcast a message to the CAN bus
every 500ms. The message will contain an ASCII string value of a monotonically
increasing integer value.

If you run the project without another node connected to the CAN bus, expect
to start seeing errors after a few messages are queued up. The sender requires
another node on the network to acknowledge the message electrically. This can
trip you up if you are first starting out with the CAN bus as it is
non-obvious why you might be getting an error.

#### The Raspberry Pi Setup

The easiest way to get CAN support on your Raspberry Pi is to buy a daughter
board from SK Pang:
the[PICAN](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-p-1196.html)
board. You can build your own configuration using mcp2515 and mcp2551 ICs, but
for the price the PICAN is an easy bet.

Today the Raspberry Pi setup is much easier than ever before. Pick the
2015-02-16 or newer version of Raspian and you will not have to compile any
kernel modules.

See this [blog post](http://skpang.co.uk/blog/archives/1165) on SK Pang
site on setting up your complete system.

On the RPi, the regular SK Pang setup they have documented works great. On
mine, the end of my /boot/config.txt looks like:

```
dtparam=spi=on dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0-overlay,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=25 dtoverlay=spi-bcm2835-overlay dtoverlay=spi-dma-overlay
```

and then my /etc/network/interfaces file looks like:

```
auto can0 iface can0 inet manual pre-up ip link set $IFACE type can bitrate 500000 listen-only off triple-sampling on up /sbin/ifconfig $IFACE up down /sbin/ifconfig $IFACE down
```

The ip command can give you a big clue on state if you use this command:

```
root@raspberrypi:~# ip -details -statistics link show can0 
3: can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT qlen 10 
link/can 
can <TRIPLE-SAMPLING>
**state ERROR-ACTIVE** 
restart-ms 0 bitrate 500000 
sample-point 0.875 tq 125 prop-seg 6 phase-seg1 7 phase-seg2 2 sjw 1 
mcp251x: tseg1 3..16 tseg2 2..8 sjw 1..4 brp 1..64 brp-inc 1
**clock 8000000** re-started bus-errors arbit-lost error-warn error-pass bus-off 
```

The couple of things I bolded are key. The clock should be 1/2 of what the
oscillator setting in config.txt is (weird quirk). The state is the actual
MCP2515 state - so error-active is what you usually want to see. Error-passive
or Bus-off are bad. See the mcp2515 datasheet for details there.

You'll want can-utils downloaded and
installed: [https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils)

Then, if you run the Arduinoo project so it's sending data every 500
ms, and then run this command on the RPi, you should see some similar output:

```
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ candump -t a -c -c -a can0 
(1452184714.419422) can0 1FF [8] 31 34 32 35 33 00 00 00 '14253...' 
(1452184714.939332) can0 1FF [8] 31 34 32 35 34 00 00 00 '14254...'
(1452184715.459257) can0 1FF [8] 31 34 32 35 35 00 00 00 '14255...'
```

You can use the can-utils for just about everything. cansend and canplayer are
useful for sending messages, candump and cansniffer are the two used for
watching data (cansniffer is especially awesome for figuring out what's really
happening). If you want to write custom software that uses CAN on the RPi,
then you can use these as examples. It's effectively just using the socket
system calls.

So that's pretty much it. You have to have the bus speed match, you have to
have the correct wiring, but otherwise that's all there is to it. I've got a
setup with an Arduino as shown below, the RPi as shown below,
another RPi with a different CAN board (still mcp25xx), and a breadboard cased
ATMEGA setup without the Arduino hardware. All works great.
