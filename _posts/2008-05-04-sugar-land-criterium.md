Today was the Sugar Land Criterium bicycle races in Sugar Land Town Square. This event was hosted by [Sugar Cycles](http://www.sugarcycles.com/), a bike store local to the Sugar Land area.

The course was a 1 mile loop through the town square itself. It was a very technical course, but luckily I don't believe there were any crashes during the entire day.

We watched the men's category 4/5, men's category 3/4, women's and junior's open, and then the men's pro / 1 / 2 / 3 races. The final event was the most amazing to watch as the skill levels within that group were amazing similar and the pack kept closely together throughout most of the race. In the other races there were large separations between groups as the skill differences in riders were so vast.

It was a great event, and the folks at Sugar Cycles did a great job in organizing it.

Lori took some pictures of the event, and they can be found at [http://www.pbase.com/skinnyorangecat/may\_2008](http://www.pbase.com/skinnyorangecat/may_2008)
