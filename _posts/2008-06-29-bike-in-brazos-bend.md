Today I tried a bike ride out that I've been wanting to do for a while. It's a
route that goes from my house down to [Brazos Bend State
Park](http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/brazos_bend/) in
Needville, Texas. The route roughly follows SH 6, then FM 521, FM 1462 and
then finally FM 762 to the park entrance. From my front door to the park
entrance gate is 39 miles.

A pretty strong afternoon storm blew in right before I got there and it was
getting late so I had Lori come pick me up in the park.

At 80 miles the full round-trip would make a great long bike ride, except I'm
not that pleased with the route itself. Getting to FM 521 is proving to be a
dangerous proposition anytime outside of early Sunday morning; FM 521 itself
is seeing increased traffic and increased road debris; FM 1462 and FM 762 are
relatively quiet but the local farm traffic turns off a bit too much.
