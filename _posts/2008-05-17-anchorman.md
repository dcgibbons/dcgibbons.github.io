Tonight we watched [Anchorman: The Legend of Ron
Burgundy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357413/). If you've ever seen a Will
Ferrell movie then you'd have a good idea of what to expect from this one, and
I certainly wasn't disappointed in that respect.

It was an incredibly stupid movie, and yet, somehow I couldn't stop laughing
through most of it. I don't know if I could stand to watch it again, but it
fits the bill for exactly what it is supposed to be.

Christinia Applegate looks better now at ~36/37 than she ever has before.
