This morning I finished reading [Blood
Canticle](http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Canticle-Vampire-Chronicles-Anne/dp/0345443691
"Blood Canticle"), another of Anne Rice's vampire universe novels. This book
is set immediately after the [Blackwood
Farm](http://www.amazon.com/Blackwood-Farm-Vampire-Chronicles-Anne/dp/0345443683
"Blackwood Farm") novel that I
[read](http://chadgibbons.com/2008/05/05/blackwood-farm/) a couple of months
ago. It continues the integration of the vampire and witch storylines that
Rice has cultivated, and this time thoroughly mixes in the Taltos portion of
the witches story as well.

It was a decent novel, told again from Lestat's point of view which make for
the most interesting of her novels. Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5.
