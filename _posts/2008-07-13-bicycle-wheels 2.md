I've been pondering the idea of getting a second set of wheels for my bike for a while now. Since I've been occasionally racing, it is convenient to have a set of wheels with the the race tires and tubes already installed. I didn't necessarily want to spend the bucks on a set of carbon fiber wheels, at least not yet, so I thought about getting a second Bontrager Race Lite wheel-set; these came with the bike and I've been really pleased with them. They are only 1660g for the set so I'm not saving a ton of weight if I upgrade.

Luckily the folks at Bike Barn suggested a different approach. They pointed me to the Bontrager Race wheel-set, which are only 139g heavier than the Race Lite version, coupled with the [Bontrager Race Lite Hardcase tires](http://bontrager.com/model/00443/en). These should prove to be a great and resilient wheel-set for training and long century rides.

Unfortunately the wheels did not come with rim tape properly installed (whoops!) so after a couple of flats this morning I had to go back and have them fix it. They were gracious enough to do it immediately so I should be all set for my next ride.
