Today I took my road bike on a trip from the Chisos Basin down to the Rio
Grande Village in [Big Bend National Park](http://www.nps.gov/bibe/). This is
a 30 mile one-way route that is almost entirely downhill.

The Chisos Basin visitor center is at 5,400 feet elevation and the Rio Grande
Village visitor center is at 1,850 feet elevation: 3,550 feet of total descent
= fun! There was around 700 feet total ascent, most of which occurred right at
the beginning to get out of the Chisos Basin itself. Unfortunately this means
you aren't quite warmed up before tackling the hardest hills of the route and
at the highest altitude. The good news is that if you can handle those hills,
you can probably handle the return trip up to the Chisos Basin, either all the
way from Rio Grande Village or just from Panther Junction.

There was a surprise around mile marker 14 west of Panther Junction: a coyote
decided I'd make a fun chase. I was cruising around 25 MPH when I heard the
pitter-patter of paws on the asphalt as the coyote ran from the desert onto
the road in full chase. Two things were immediately clear: I had activated his
chase instinct so it was either outrun or fight, and coyotes are a lot faster
than domestic dogs. I had to bring the speed up to over 30 MPH for almost a
half mile before he gave up the chase.

I spoke to an older ranger a couple of days later about this and he said yes,
this does happen and there's little you can do about it other than not ride.
He said all 3 of the big predators in the park (coyotes, bears and mountain
lions) have a strong chase instinct and if they actually start after you it's
too late; coyotes just happen to be the only ones you can actually outrun. He
mentioned that they are used to seeing people walk and vehicles drive by, but
bicyclists and trail runners are slow enough and interesting enough it really
excites their instinct.

This was my first time biking in the park and it was fantastic. The park is of
course very isolated and the low speed limits (45 MPH) gives the little bit of
vehicular traffic ample time to avoid you. At bicycle speeds you can often
sneak up on wildlife (or be snuck up upon...). The road quality, while older
asphalt, is rather decent and makes for a nice, smooth and fast ride.
