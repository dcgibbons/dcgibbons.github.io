On October 15th registration opened for the 2009 BP MS 150 ride from Houston
to Austin. The event filled up in record time, only about 7 hours, compared to
11 days last year. This will be my 5th year to ride in the event; when I first
started, I missed signing up several years in a row because I never really
thought about it until it was too late. It's clear those days are over. I
wouldn't be surprised if there's a lottery style system brought into play at
some point.

I'm going to try and be slightly more aggressive with soliciting contributions
this year. Not badgering people, but making the information available in a
variety of places. We'll see where that leads.

I'll start here. If you want to contribute to my fund raising goal visit my
