Sunday I took another stab at biking from the house to Brazos Bend state park. As before, I foolishly waited until it was too hot before I left and was amply punished for it.

I left just after 10am and it was already over 90F. By the time I made it the 40 miles into the park I was completely wasted despite all of the food and drink I had during the ride.

After the ride I discovered I had lost 3 lbs of water weight since before the ride began, despite the 3 bottles of water, 12 oz of coke, 32 oz of gatoraide, 20 oz of coke zero, a banana, cookies, and a Clif bar.

Amazing. I am looking forward to fall. Thank God Lori rescued me again.
