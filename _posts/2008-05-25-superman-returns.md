Tonight we watched [Superman Returns](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/). I was not expecting much from a sequel like this, but I was pleasantly surprised.

[Brandon Routh](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746125/)'s portrayal of Superman himself was probably not as good as Christopher Reeve's original, but just about ever other character had a much better actor choice. [Kate Bosworth](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0098378/) was a fantastic Lois Lane and [Kevin Spacey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000228) is an amazingly good choice for Lex Luthor.

I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
