Ever year after the MS150 I take up running. Last year I had the wrong kind of
shoes and I stopped after only a few weeks for fear of hurting my achilles
tendon. This year I went to my local&nbsp;[Fleet
Feet](http://www.fleetfeethouston.com/) who hooked me up with a new pair of
[Mizuno](http://www.mizunousa.com/running) running shoes that felt great and
gave me some extra support for my slight pronation.

So this evening I went for my first run of the season. I went for 5 miles
today with 2.5 miles of that actually running. The running portions were at a
10:30 minutes/mile pace. The shoes worked out great!
