This morning I finished reading [Category
7](http://www.amazon.com/Category-7-Bill-Evans/dp/0765317354), a thriller
about a monster hurricane that destroys much of coastal New York City.

The plot of the book is actually quite good. A former government scientist
focused on weather control returns to the subject once he has amassed a
fortune in the private sector. He masters the ability to create and harness
weather and begins to unleash the monster hurricane as a lesson to his
arch-nemesis, the President of the United States. Meanwhile, scientists within
the CIA begin to notice something might not be right about the weather...

Unfortunately a good thriller plot is coupled with some not so great writing.
I'm pretty tolerant on writing styles but this one felt too much like someone
had just read a book on "writing fiction in 21 days" or something along those
lines. It had a tremendous quality of a "made for hollywood" movie that didn't
want you to think too hard.

Glad I read it, but I wouldn't read it again. I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.
