*The Jeep's Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC) Displays a Custom Message*

I have a [2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited](http://www.jeep.com/en/2012/wrangler_unlimited/)
and have a few projects where I wanted to integrate closely with
the vehicle's electronics. Instead of tapping into the final wiring of the
car, I wanted to leverage the vehicle's own computers to tell my accessories
what to do. The end goal being a much tighter and seamless integration, and
much less modification to the wiring of the vehicle.

Modern automobiles use a technology called a [Controller Area Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus), or
CAN-Bus, to communicate between the different computers within the vehicle.
The use of this technology greatly simplifies the wiring requirements within
the vehicle as a large number of components can share a single twisted-pair
wiring harness.

There are actually three separate CAN bus systems used in the vehicle: the
CAN-Interior (also known as CAN Interior High Speed/IHS), the CAN-C and the
Diagnostic CAN-C. The CAN-Interior bus is used for communication between the
interior modules of the vehicle, such as the dashboard and radio and runs at
125 Kbps. The CAN-C bus is used by the power train components and runs at 500
Kbps. Finally, there is the Diagnostic CAN-C which also runs at 500 Kbps.

The Diagnostic CAN-C bus is used to talk to a gateway computer, the Totally
Integrated Power Module or TIPM. This gateway implements all of the logic
needed for onboard diagnostics, and communicates to the other two buses as
needed. One effect of this implementation is that data from the other buses is
not easily obtained via the data link connector (a.k.a the
[ODB-II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) port) underneath 
the dash. While a tremendous amount of
information is available via the diagnostic bus, it isn't easy to hack or
obtain without getting official documentation from the manufacturer directly.

I came across [canbushack.com](http://canbushack.com "canbushack.com")
when I was thinking about looking at the CAN-interior bus and was happy to see
much of the information I was after is on that bus. Unfortunately, I also
found that the implementation has changed quite a bit from the time most of
the work was done on that site versus what is in my Jeep today.

![Radio C2](/assets/images/jeep_custom_c2_harness.jpg)
*Custom Wiring Harness using the Radio C2 Connector*

The easiest way to access the CAN-interior bus is the [radio C2
harness.](http://connectors.dcctools.com/details.htm?id=77646 "Mopar
68032281AA - Radio C2")I built a pigtail wiring harness by buying a
couple of aftermarket radio wiring harnesses, linking them together, and
splicing in a pair of wires for the CAN-H and CAN-L connectors. By making a
custom pigtail like this I avoided having to alter any of the OEM wiring
making for both easy removal and a lower risk of screwing up something.

I originally used an Arduino Uno micro-controller board and a [CAN interface
shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10039 "CAN-Bus Shield for Arduino")
from [SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com "SparkFun") and [SK Pang
Electronics](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/arduino-canbus-shield-with-usd-card-holder-p-706.html
"Arduino CAN-Bus Shield"). This platform is a prototype for what I will
eventually use as the final production solution for my projects, but I quickly
found that analyzing and hacking the vehicle's CAN-Interior bus was too
tedious with that solution, for two primary reasons: a) I had to write code to
test any hypothesis, and b) I had to be physically connected to the Arduino
with my laptop, in the car, in the cold of winter.

![RPi](/assets/images/raspberry_pi_with_canbus_board.jpg)
*Raspberry Pi with CAN Interface Board*

To solve both issues, I configured a Raspberry Pi system with a CAN interface
board made specifically for it by [SK Pang
Electronics](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-p-1196.html
"PICAN Board for Raspberry Pi") and a[USB WiFi
dongle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MTTJOY/ref=oh_details_o05_s01_i00
"Edimax EW-7811Un 150 Mbps Wireless 11n Nano Size USB Adapter") so I could
leave the system in the vehicle and login to it from the comfort of my living
room. Since the RPi is a temporary research solution only, I only placed
into the glovebox, connected the CAN-H and CAN-L wires, and used a USB power
supply directly from the vehicle's 12v auxiliary power port.

Configuring the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the CAN Bus is unfortunately
non-trivial, and I will cover that in another post.

What's great about using Linux for CAN-bus hacking is the plethora of great
tools available.
The [can-utils](https://gitorious.org/linux-can/can-utils "can-utils
package") package in particular contains the command-line tools I used to
analyze CAN bus messages and generate my own.

The very first thing to do is to look at the traffic on the bus using the
`candump` utility. This utility does exactly what it sounds like - dumps all
of the traffic it sees on the bus to your terminal or to a file. When I first
tried `candump` on the CAN-Interior bus of the Jeep, I started to see data
like this:
```
id:0x402 len:8 rtr:0 data:0xfe 0x02 0x3f 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff

id:0x211 len:8 rtr:0 data:0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff
```

What a mess! That amount of data flashed across the screen in less than a
quarter second and began to repeat in long cycles. It was very difficult to
look at such a stream of data and detect when changes occurred based upon user
action. Luckily, the `can-utils` package includes another awesome tool called
`cansniffer` that can help with that very problem.

When you run `cansniffer`, it looks at the traffic for specific message ids
and begins to filter out repeating messages that do not change. After a few
seconds of startup time, the Jeep is left with the following changing data
while in accessory mode:

```
214 04 12 70 00 13 11 00 ..p....
217 63 78 07 40 6b fd cx.@k.
219 01 47 35 43 4c 32 37 31 .G5CL271
3e6 00 0d 12 ...
```

It was clear from watching cansniffer what some of this data was.

Message Id `$219` is the vehicle identification number repeated over and over.
The first byte of the message is the message #, `$00` through `$04` with the
VIN split across each.

Message Id `$3e6` is a clock of the hours, minutes and seconds since the
vehicle was turned on.

I was then able to operate switches in the vehicle and discover the following
messages in short order:  

```
244 81 00 39 C3 80 # Driver's door open, byte 0
244 80 00 39 C3 80 # Driver's door closed, byte 0
208 01 22 6d 5a 1e 01 2c # Left blinker on, byte 0
208 00 22 6d 6a 1e 01 2c # Left blinker off, byte 0
208 02 22 6d 5a 1e 01 2c # Right blinker on, byte 0
208 00 22 6d 6a 1e 01 2c # Right blinker off, byte 0
1e1 00 00 10 65 00 00 00 00 # Steering wheel position, bytes 3 & 4
2e0 00 01 47 21 ff ff 0c # Brake pedal depressed, byte 4
2e0 00 01 47 20 ff ff 0c # Brake pedal released, byte 4
2e7 84 1c 00 00 00 00 87 # Parking brake on, byte 0
2e7 04 1c 00 00 00 00 87 # Parking brake off, byte 0
292 00 49 33 00 00 48 28 # Throttle pressed, byte 3
2a8 00 01 00 00 00 00 # Windshield wipers, byte 3
2e5 03 # Rear wiper
2d2 01 06 00 # 4WD-HI
2d2 04 04 00 # 4WD-LO
2d2 00 03 00 # 2WD
```

Some of the data in each message is immediately apparent and others will take
some more analysis to figure out what each byte represents. I was particularly
surprised to see that the steering wheel movement t generated any data at all
on the CAN-Interior bus.

Some actions result in multiple messages being generated. In particular, the
lights appear to generate two message id's when state is changed, one to two
with id `$208` and another with id `$2e1`. Here's what I've found so far:  

```
208 00 22 6d 5a 1e 01 2c # Lights on w/ fogs
208 58 22 6d 51 1e 01 2c
2e1 1a

208 00 22 6d 5a 1e 01 2c # Lights off w/ fogs  
2e1 1b

2e1 1b # Fogs on  
2e1 0b # Fogs off  
2e1 0a # Lights on w/o fogs  
2e1 0b # Lights off w/o fogs

The Radio generates a lot of data, too:  

```
29e 00 03 97 20 02 ff ff ff # Change to FM 91.9`

291 09 01 05 30 f0 00 07 # Change to satellite, w/ no signal  
293 00 00 b8 20 02 ff ff ff

291 01 01 05 10 10 00 07 # Change to FM, 91.5  
291 00 03 93 20 02 ff ff ff

291 09 01 05 30 80 00 07 # Change satellite stations  
293 00 00 19 23 02 ff ff ff  
295 43 65 73 52 65 77 6e 64 # ClsRewnd

29e 00 00 0f 21 02 00 00 00 # Change CD tracks, byte 3

3d9 0a 0a 0a 0a 0a ff # Change volume, byte 0  
3d9 08 0a 0a 0a 0a ff # Change volume, byte 0
```

Message id `$295` is the most fun, as any message broadcast with that id will
appear on the vehicle's EVIC message line, assuming you have disabled the ECO
option from being displayed.

Stay tuned for more information about the bus, how to setup both the Arduino
and Raspberry Pi to talk to a CAN bus, and details about upcoming projects.
