Tonight we saw [Iron Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/) with friends.
My self-imposed media blackout meant I had no idea what the movie was. In
fact, until a week or so before it came out I hadn't even heard of it! I've
found this makes for a much better movie...

This was a fun film. There's not a whole lot to say about it given how current
it is, but overall I really enjoyed it. The suspension of disbelief was alive
through most of the film including the over the top features of the suit, but
it did fall through a bit when the main character was working with his
computers. As usual it was so fantastic that it just doesn't seem plausible,
even in the foreseeable future. But luckily this didn't detract from the film
at all since the visuals were so well done.

Someone needs to let Gwyneth know that's it's okay to eat a cheeseburger now
and then a gain a few pounds. She could weigh 20 pounds more than she does now
and still look fantastic in that role... probably even more than that.

Overall, I'd give it a 4 out of 5.
