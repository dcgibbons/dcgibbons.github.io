Tonight I raced in my second bicycle criterium at the [crit
series](http://www.hansschneidercycles.com/ "Memorial Park Criterium Series")
held every Wednesday night in [Memorial
Park](http://www.houstontx.gov/parks/memorialpark.html "Houston Memorial
Park"). This was week 6 of the series this summer and the first chance I had
to race; I had been out during week 4 but I forgot my cycling license that day
so I just watched.

I had a long 45 minute warmup before the race started; in retrospect that was
way too long of a warmup. The race started out with the girls being given a
warmup and then a prime lap and the guys were asked not to pass the girls
until their prime lap was over. This gave us 2 laps at a comfortable pace of
23 to 24 mph that made for a great warmup all on its own. As soon as the race
began in earnest the speeds kicked up to 28 mph and I only made it about 3/4
of the way through that lap before I was dropped.

I tried the auto-lap feature of my [heart rate
monitor](http://www.polarusa.com/Products/consumer/S725X.asp "Polar S725x")
and tried hard to ignore it completely during the race, for better or worse.
Looking back at the data afterwards gives me a pretty clear idea of what I can
maintain in at a casual pace, a fast solo pace, and a fast group pace. There's
a lot of room left for improvement just to be able to keep up with the main
pack, but that is really not a surprise at all.

The Memorial Park picnic loop is a great circuit for the race. The circuit is
long enough that if you aren't in the main pack you will have room to ride
without being constantly lapped. Most of the corners in the circuit are fast
and easy, with only two requiring a great deal of care. We didn't have any
wrecks in this weeks' race, but I understand that here have been plenty this
season, but that's somewhat to be expected of aggressive criterium racing.

I will say that the [Madone 5.2
Pro](http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/2008/road/madone/madone52pro/ "Trek
Madone 5.2 Pro") I'm riding now corners like it is on rails and it is just an
amazingly bike for building confidence - at least until the first time I go
down.
