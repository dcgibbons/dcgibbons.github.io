This morning I finished reading [Blood Canticle](http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Canticle-Vampire-Chronicles-Anne/dp/0345443691 "Blood Canticle"), another of Anne Rice's vampire universe novels. This book is set immediately after the [Blackwood Farm](http://www.amazon.com/Blackwood-Farm-Vampire-Chronicles-Anne/dp/0345443683 "Blackwood Farm") novel that I [read](http://chadgibbons.com/2008/05/05/blackwood-farm/) a couple of months ago. It continues the integration of the vampire and witch storylines that Rice has cultivated, and this time thoroughly mixes in the Taltos portion of the witches story as well.

It was a decent novel, told again from Lestat's point of view which make for the most interesting of her novels. Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5.
