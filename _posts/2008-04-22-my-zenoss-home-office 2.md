My work environment at [Zenoss](http://www.zenoss.com/) involves working out of my home part of the time, and then spending a week or so a month at our Austin office.

I had originally planned on using my Mac Pro and large monitor as my workstation and then just using the [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) built-in Screen Saver tool to connect to my laptop as needed. After a few days I realized this wasn't going to work that well, so I set about getting an actual workspace just for Zenoss activities. ![My Zenoss Workspace]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IMG_0423.png)

Luckily I had an extra small computer cart from [Anthro](http://www.anthro.com/) that I could use. I wound up using a spare [Dell](http://www.dell.com/) monitor and some newly purchased wireless input devices and then I was in business.

So far, this is working out well. It is making it easier to not be distracted by non-work computer stuff as well, since I don't have everything personal on my work laptop.
