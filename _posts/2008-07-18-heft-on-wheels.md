I just finished reading [Heft On Wheels: A Field Guide to Doing A 180](http://www.amazon.com/Heft-Wheels-Field-Guide-Doing/dp/1400052416), by [Mike Magnuson](http://www.lummox.org/). Magnuson gives us a pretty deep glimpse into himself has he rapidily transforms himself from a fat, drunken slob into a highly active road bicycle junkie.

Magnuson discovers what I also discovered a few years ago when I started cycling: high-intensity exercise with a purpose can be extremely liberating and can totally change your outlook on life. Cycling is a great fit for this, given that it is relatively easy for people to get up off the couch and get on the bike and get to the point where they can ride for hours on end.

Overall I'd give the book 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is an entertaining read, even if you aren't a cyclist.
