A friend came across this [blog
entry](http://consumerist.com/5046479/dell-doesnt-care-where-you-live-keeps-delivering-packages-to-the-wrong-address
"Dell Doesn't Care Where You Live, Keeps Delivering Packages To The Wrong
Address") on the [Consumerist](http://consumerist.com/) that details another
saga of pain and suffering caused by the wonderful ability to Dell customer
service to screw up. Given it's another issue with the interaction between
Dell and DHL it really makes you go "hmmm..."

It really sounds like someone high up in Dell needs to get out the clue bat
and work on their customer service team and how they deal with DHL. I
personally find DHL to be the worst of the big courier services to begin with,
but Dell is the one causing most of the grief here.
