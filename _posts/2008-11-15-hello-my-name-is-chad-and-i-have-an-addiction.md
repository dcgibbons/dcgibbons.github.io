I am, quite simply put, addicted to shiny new cars.

It has been almost two whole years since I've purchased a new vehicle and the
itch has returned, and when it does it's all consuming until it has been
scratched. I will now be obsessing over cars until either I buy another one,
or something else takes my mind off of them.

When I drove home from Austin this Friday night, I saw a nice new shiny BMW M5
sedan that I shadowed the entire way. I really wanted one of these when the
new generation came out, and in many ways I think it would be the perfect
vehicle to replace the two I currently drive. The price for a new one is a bit
obscene and used ones are as hard to find as gold, and the 17 MPG freeway
rating is worse than my Tahoe, so I have yet to pull the trigger. And yet,
I've come very close to doing exactly that.

I've also always wanted a Porsche 911. Much like the BMW, a new one is so
overpriced that I've always found other vehicles that were "better" for a much
lower price. And yet, I know I need to have one someday just to see. I see
several folks locally that have theirs with a bike rack on top, so I could
conceivably replace both vehicles I drive today with one. I've heard
automotive experts say again and again that the base 911 Carrera is the best
of all the 911 models, given its relatively simplicity, but it would be so
hard to "settle" with just that instead of an S or Turbo. I'll ignore the GTx
models for obvious reasons...

But it isn't just the super fast expensive cars that get my attention. I'd
love to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen TDI right now, too. This is a
great little machine, and would make an excellent daily driver and bike
carrier. VW's new TDI engine is an outstanding work of engineering resulting
some rather amazing real world fuel economy figures. Clearly, from my other
choices and current vehicles, fuel economy is very important to me...

One day, I should just give in and buy a used car. I still have never done it.
My very first car was used, but it was my parents old beater that I inherited.
All of my other vehicles since then have been new - a whopping 9 since 1991,
and 11 if you count the two we've bought for my wife in that same period. And,
if I could really stop being dumb about it all, I should just stop buying
vehicles all together. I should really just now be breaking in my 2nd car...

But, oooh, they're so shiny.
