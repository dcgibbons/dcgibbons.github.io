Last night my friend Matt and I saw [The Cure](http://www.thecure.com/) perform at the [Houston Toyota Center](http://www.houstontoyotacenter.com/). It was a great, and very long, show. They took the stage around 8:30 pm and didn't finish up until just before midnight after their 3rd encore.

3rd Encore- A Forest

I had not seen The Cure in concert before, so I wasn't sure what the crowd would be like. Not surprisingly, it was almost entirely people who grew up with the band. More surprisingly, to me, was just how much the crowd was into it; several times it seemed the entire hall was singing outloud with some of the songs.
