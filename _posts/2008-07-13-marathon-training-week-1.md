Yesterday I capped off my first official week of marathon training with the
[Fort Bend Fit](http://www.fortbendfit.org/ "Fort Bend Fit") training group.
Their training plan have 3 runs during the week with a long run every Saturday
morning. I'm in the Red group, for those with a 10 to 12 minute per mile pace
over 5K. I'm presently running closer to a 9 minute mile which would place me
in the Yellow group, but I want to see if I can maintain my pace over longer
distances before I change running groups.

This week's Saturday run was approximately 3 miles. It was a nice, easy run
compared to some of the other runs earlier in the week where for one reason or
another I kept bonking. Running in a very large group is actually great fun
and really helps keep motivation up. My pace for the entire run, including a
couple of waits for lights, was 10:30; average heart rate was 162 with a peak
of 173.

This Saturday was also the first time I wore my [Amphipod Running
Belt](http://www.amphipod.com/8400/8400.html)with 3 bottles. It was reasonably
comfortable, and having liquid available anytime during the run was nice, but
at this point I'd really rather not wear it. I can get away with not wearing
it on 30 minute or less runs, but longer than that it is mandatory.

For the week as a whole, I ran 2 hours 16 minutes and 10.5 miles, plus a few
cycling rides and a cycling criterium on Wednesday. I'm looking forward to
week 2 where Saturday's run is 4 miles.

Running so far this summer has been going well. Resting a couple of weeks
after I [hurt my knee](http://chadgibbons.com/2008/04/30/training-run-2/),
plus some running form advice from my friend Teri, led to me being able to run
much further, faster, and with no discomfort. I was even able to go on a
[great ~7 mile run](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2014383) around the [US
Naval Academy](http://www.usna.edu/)when I was visiting Annapolis for work a
couple of weeks ago.

I'm currently signed up for the [Aramco Houston Half
Marathon](http://www.chevronhoustonmarathon.com/Half_Marathon.htm) on January
18, 2009 but I may try the full marathon depending upon how training
progresses and how my run in the [Houston
Half](http://www.houstonhalf.com/)marathon on October 26, 2008 goes. Balancing
running time with bicycling time will likely prove to be the most difficult
part of the training season.
