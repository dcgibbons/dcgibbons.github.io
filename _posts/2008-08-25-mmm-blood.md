I donated a unit of whole blood today, which I try and do as often as I am
able. It used to never bother me, but the combination of being smaller and
older appear to be taking its toll. After today's donation I have been pretty
loopy for the rest of the day. Way loopy, like I shouldn't be driving or using
a computer loopy.

I've also got this thing for needles. I don't mean I look away and get faint
when needles are near, like most people, I mean that I like watching them go
in. It is a little odd to explain, but there is something quite satisfying to
know that yes indeed, that does hurt a tiny bit just like it is supposed to.
The nurse who drained me today called me sick for watching.
