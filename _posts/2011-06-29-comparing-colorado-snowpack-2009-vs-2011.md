I managed to take a picture of the Taylor Reservoir this June in almost the
same place as when I took a picture in June 2009. Both pictures were taken
while riding on bicycle tours, but the results are very different.

In 2009, the picture was taken in late June, after a winter of relatively
little snow. This year, the picture was taken in mid June, after a winter of
very heavy snow and a long, cool spring.

It is also clear from the pictures just how low the reservoir level was this
year compared to the past.

Clouds make for more awesome pictures.
