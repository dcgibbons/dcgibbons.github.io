I didn't expect a clean resolution to my Dell issue, given it wasn't done yet,
but I had more of the same when I called DHL and Dell back on Tuesday.

DHL tells me no, there is no return tracking # because the package really was
stolen. "You need to call Dell and have them open a claim with us." Okay...
since they're being responsive today I can call Dell back and have them call
DHL, right? Wrong... My call to Dell goes like all the others: "Sir, we have
to wait 48 hours until the last scan on DHL's web site before we can open a
trace with DHL." Uh, WTF people? How about actually trying to resolve my issue
for me?

I politely told them I was done with them, and then I called up Citibank.
Within 5 minutes I had a credit issued and a promise from Citibank that they
would work with the merchant to resolve the issue.

Absolutely amazing.
