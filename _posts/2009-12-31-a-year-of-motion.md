The end of the year is always a good time for reflection. One of the things I always do is look at how much time and distance I've spent in a car or on a bicycle.

2009 was a record year for riding in a cars at just over 21,000 miles, just over my previous record driving year of 2008 which was around 19,000 miles.

On the bicycles, I only managed 2,000 miles, significantly less than my 2008 peak of 2,700 miles.
