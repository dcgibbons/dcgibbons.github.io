Tonight we watched [The Good Shepherd](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343737/)
again. I wanted to watch this movie twice since it was so long (just under 3
hours) and deep enough that it warranted a closer look.

This movie focuses around Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon, and his role in
the OSS and the early days of the CIA. Wilson is a counter-intelligence expert
who battles against the Soviets, climaxing with the Cuban missile crisis. The
story focuses heavily on Wilson's interactions with women, his colleagues, and
his Soviet counterparts.

Neat things in the film are a relative lack of a classic Hollywood storyline
and a great job seeing both Matt Damon and Angelia Jolie made up to appear as
if they were in late middle age.

I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars.
