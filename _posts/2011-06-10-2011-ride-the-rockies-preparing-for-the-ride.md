When I finally made it to 12,000 ft elevation, I thought for sure I'd feel
better than I had in the past. After all, I live at sea level, and any
additional time at high elevation should help my acclimation quite a bit. This
year, I've been in Colorado exploring and training for almost a full month
before the [Ride the Rockies](http://www.ridetherockies.com/) begins - I
should be getting somewhat used to the higher altitudes by now. But that climb
up to 12,000 ft reminded me how foolish I was to think it would come so easy.
It was easy to get out of breath just doing a normal pace walk, even after all
the time here.

The effects of the higher elevation on me are different than I would really
have expected. Yes, if I jump right into it from sea-level, I'll get the
classic headaches and a bit of dehydration. But more surprising is how it
effects my riding. I don't see increased heart rates, and I don't see a longer
time to recover after a hard effort. What I do see, though, is a precipitous
drop in power output compared to riding back home. After a season of training,
that's quite frankly annoying to see performance drop just because of a few
little, er, massive mountains.

Still, it's great fun climbing up these things, especially given back home in
coastal Texas I can ride for 70 or 80 miles and see a grand total of 150 ft in
elevation gain. Climbing 5,000 or more ft a day really lets you know your body
had some hard work to do, and the feeling is incredible.

I've been lucky enough this spring to be able to spend some extra time in
Colorado and do some of my favorite rides: Durango to Silverton, the Colorado
National Monument, and a loop up Grand Mesa. These are amazing rides,
especially so for someone like me who doesn't live in the state and has few
chances to ride them.

The first day of this year's Ride the Rockies is the day I look forward to the
most, thanks to Cottonwood Pass. I rode up Cottonwood Pass back in 2009 on
another tour, and it was fantastic fun, despite the heavy rain, fog, and new
freezing weather we had the entire way up. I didn't get a chance to ride down
into Buena Vista because the ride course was shut down, something I'm hoping
to correct this year.
