Today Dell contacted me four times - twice by e-mail and twice by phone - to
inform me that a credit has been issued by them for the laptop that was stolen
in transit. It took 8 business days after they said they would issue a credit
and 13 business days after the laptop was originally estimated to be
delivered.

The saga isn't over until the credit actually hits my credit card account, but
in all likelihood that will be tomorrow morning.
