If you saw my post about hacking the [CAN-Interior bus of a
JK](http://chadgibbons.com/2013/12/29/hacking-the-jeep-interior-can-bus/), you
noticed my comments about building an intelligent accessory switching system.
I'm [pretty far
along](http://chadgibbons.com/2014/01/09/jeep-bot-proof-of-concept-1/) with
that, and would love to get some feedback from the community on features
they'd like to see.

Right now my plan is to build something, release it all with open-source and
open-hardware so people can build their own, but there's been enough interest
for people who would like to have one built for themselves that I made the
following survey. If you have a moment, I would really appreciate your
feedback.

Once the survey is all done, I'll post the results here too so everyone can
see the data.

And if you aren't sure exactly what I'm talking about - it's effectively a
standard relay box in your engine bay, but instead of _just_ toggle switches,
it's smart and listens to your car's computers and can activate switches when
lights go on/off, high-beams, blinkers, ignition - whatever we can think of.
