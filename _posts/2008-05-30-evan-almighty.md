Today we watched [Evan Almighty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/). In this movie, God, played again by Morgan Freeman, has Evan Baxter, played by Steve Carell, build a great Ark in the spirit of Noah.

Evan Baxter gets chosen by God to build the Ark after he is elected to the US Congress on a _Change the World_ platform. He's skeptical of the entire ordeal but eventually enough strange things occur, such as animals coming to him in pairs, that he gives in and builds the Ark.

I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars. It was a fun comedy but not worth watching twice. Steve Carell, while funny, seems to be too typecast in the idiot role.
