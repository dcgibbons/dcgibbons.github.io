Due to recent negative events with XM Radio's customer service, I no longer
have an XM subscription in any of my vehicles. In the truck there is an
auxiliary input jack, so feeding music from an iPod is a no-brainer. But in
the Corvette, there was no such option. GM never really provided a great
solution for it, but luckily the aftermarket came to the rescue.

One of the better options is a device called the
[Lockpick](http://www.coastaletech.com/CORVETTEIPOD.htm) that intelligently
interfaces with the various radio interfaces in GM vehicles. The Corvette
Lockpick they provide interfaces directly with the navigation radio in all 6th
generation Corvettes so I ordered it to try it out.

Installation turned out to be incredibly simple. The unit ties into the wiring
harness that feeds the XM Radio brain. In the convertible model, the brain is
hidden behind the waterfall, located between the seats. Removing the waterfall
is straight-forward, and then you are left with a simple wire routing problem.

In the end, I decided to locate the Lockpick unit itself on the carpeted area
behind the waterfall. I used sticky-tape velcro to keep the unit attached to
the carpet, and then ran the wiring harness to the XM Radio unit in order to
attach the Y-connector that feeds into the Lockpick itself. The wiring harness
that connects to the iPod also has to be routed, and I decided in the end to
locate the iPod in the glove box rather than the center console. Access to the
center console would require some cutting for a clean installtion look, and
plus it tends to get rather hot inside so I was worried about shortening the
life of the iPod a bit too much to locate it there.

Luckily the glove box had a space for a switch that wasn't installed with my
option packages, so it made a perfect place to feed the wiring harness. From
there, I routed the wiring harness into the dash and then underneath the
center console and feed it directly to the waterfall area. The final result is
a perfectly clean and hidden installation with no permanent modifications
needed to the car.

The Lockpick unit itself works great, although the control system is a quirky.
The lower right-hand button in the XM Radio menu activates the iPod. Once
activated, the Category up and down buttons control your playlist selection,
and then seek forward and back buttons control the current song playing within
the playlist. The info button displays the song information as you would
expect. It's quirky, but works extremely well.
