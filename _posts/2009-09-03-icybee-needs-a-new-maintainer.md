The [IcyBee project](http://www.nuclearbunny.org/icybee/) is a client for the
[ICB chat network](http://www.icb.net/) with a graphical user interface and
written in the Java language for cross-platform portability. The current
version of the software has several years of stability behind it and few user
requests, but there is always more work to do. The project is currently hosted
on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/icybee/) and all of the
source is already available.

I'm looking for a maintainer that will take the reins of the project from me
and give the project some much needed love as time and platforms march on. If
interested, drop a comment on this post and we can discuss the possibility.
