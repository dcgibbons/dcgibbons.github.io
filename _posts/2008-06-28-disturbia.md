Tonight we watched [Disturbia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486822/), a story
about a suburban kid who suspects his neighbor is a serial killer.

In the end, of course, the kid is right, but there are several attempts at
revealing his neighbor's true colors that work out as just the kid crying
wolf. This story has been done before.

Even though it is predictable and somewhat clich√©, it is a fun story and well
executed. Overall I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars.
