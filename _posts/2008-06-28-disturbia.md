Tonight we watched [Disturbia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486822/), a story about a suburban kid who suspects his neighbor is a serial killer.

In the end, of course, the kid is right, but there are several attempts at revealing his neighbor's true colors that work out as just the kid crying wolf. This story has been done before.

Even though it is predictable and somewhat clich√©, it is a fun story and well executed. Overall I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars.
