Today was my second training run of the year. I was able to run the entire [Oyster Creek Trail](http://www.sugarlandtx.gov/parks_recreation/parks_facilities/community_parks/oyster_creek.asp) without stopping, plus a quarter-mile walk on either side. The running pace was a pretty consistent 10:30 minute/mile, with the overall pace including the walking at 11:06 minute/mile. Total distance was 5.6 miles; average heart rate of 150 bpm; 728 calories burned.
