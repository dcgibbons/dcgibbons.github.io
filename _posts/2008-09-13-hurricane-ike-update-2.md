It is around 9:30am and we are still experiencing storm conditions here. We
have occasional tropical storm strength gusts and some light rain. The bulk of
the storm is north of us now so conditions should continue to improve from
here on out.

The power is still out so we got the generator out and running to keep the
freezer cold. There is no indication of how long the power will be out.

As far as damage, there is little to report. There appears to be no structual
damage to any of the homes in the neighborhood. A few small trees are down and
there are branches everywhere. Our neighbor's fence has some damage from a
small tree that fell on it, but that is all so far.

Once the storm subsides soon I will venture out on the bike to get more
details. The city's curfew ended a few minutes ago but they still want people
off the roads.
