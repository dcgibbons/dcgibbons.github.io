This past weekend I finished reading [Under the
Wire](http://www.amazon.com/Under-Wire-Adventures-Legendary-Escape/dp/0312338325),
a book by William Ash that details his travels from an American drifter to a
Spitfire pilot in the British Royal Air Force to an eventual prisoner of war
in WWII occupied Europe.

Ash was one of the remarkable POWs that spent their entire time in captivity
plotting and executing escape attempts for their various camps. These
escapades led to the 1963 movie [The Great
Escape](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057115/), which details fictional escapes
based upon the real escapes from the Stalag Luft III prison camp.

Like any book of the WWII generation, you get a tremendous sense of how
ordinary men and women performed extraordinary feats during the circumstances
of war. Anytime you are fortunate enough to meet one of rapidly dwindling
number of WWII veterans be sure to thank them for their gift to all of us,
even if they themselves don't feel they did anything special.

Overall I'd give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.
